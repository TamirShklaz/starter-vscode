# Writing Style Preferences

## Core Principles

Based on "The Day You Became A Better Writer"

### Clarity Above All

- Business writing is about clarity and persuasion
- Simple writing is persuasive
- A good argument in five sentences beats a brilliant argument in a hundred

### Keep It Simple

- Remove extra words
- Don't write "very happy" when "happy" works
- Prune sentences ruthlessly
- Each word must earn its place

### Sentence Structure

- Write short sentences
- One thought per sentence
- Use active voice: "the boy hit the ball" not "the ball was hit by the boy"
- Object before action for clarity

### First Impressions

- First sentence grabs the reader
- Make them curious
- Rewrite it until it works

## Personal Philosophy

- Efficient communication is paramount
- Minimalism in expression
- Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- Every word must justify its existence

## Application

- Documentation: Clear, concise, actionable
- Comments: Only when necessary
- Explanations: Build from simple to complex
- Responses: Direct and to the point
