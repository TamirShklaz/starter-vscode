# Inbox Protocol

## Untriaged Rules

- Keep PRDs and tasks implementation-agnostic. Focus on high-level goals and intent, not technical solutions.
- After completing code changes, run TypeScript compiler to check for errors: `bunx tsc --noEmit` in the relevant directory
- Run Biome formatter after making changes: `moon :check` to check formatting, `moon :lint` to fix issues
- NEVER commit changes unless explicitly asked by the user. Only commit when the user says "commit", "git commit", or similar explicit requests

## Task Writing Guidelines

When creating implementation tasks:
- Focus on WHAT needs to be done, not HOW to implement it
- Describe the desired behavior and acceptance criteria
- Avoid writing full code implementations, components, or CSS
- Code snippets should only illustrate concepts or API usage (max 10-15 lines)
- Let the implementing AI figure out the technical details
- Include manual verification steps for QA
- List files that likely need modification, but don't prescribe exact changes
- Focus on user-facing behavior and edge cases to test
